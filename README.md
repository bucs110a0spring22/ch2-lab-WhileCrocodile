None.

## REFERENCES:
None.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I'm not sure if "variable you create that is assigned a value" includes the variables that came with the code, so I printed values and types for all of them.

I'm also not sure if "in a single print statement" means I was only supposed to use one print statement in total, or one print statement per variable that I printed. I went with the latter.
